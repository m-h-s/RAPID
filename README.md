# Rational API Designer (RAPID)

### Design Objectives
RAPID is a conversational assistant that aids software developers <br> 
in addressing non-functional requirements in the design of web APIs.

### Main Features
RAPID provides four types of guidelines to the users: <Enter>
* Elaborating and clarifying a given requirement
* Introducing a set of design alternatives to address a given requirement
* Analyzing the impact of design alternatives on non-functional requirements
* Recommending design alternatives based on the requirements of a given case

### Design and Architecture
RAPID is designed as a rule-based knowledge-based system and has four main components:<br>
* *Rule Base Component (RB)*: RB is responsible for storing and managing the rules encoding design knowledge. 
   <br><br>
* *Rule Explorer (RE)*: RE is responsible for retrieving the rules that are related to a session of interaction with a user, <br> 
  and managing them until the interaction session ends.
  <br><br> 
* *User Interaction Component (UIM)*: UIM allows a user to interact with the system, to pose design queries over the rule base, to and receive a set of responses. 
<br><br>
* *Reasoner*: Reasoner is responsible for evaluating the rules related to an interaction session and selecting and recommending appropriate design solutions. 

### Implementation
RAPID is a working prototype implemented in Java.

### Release Dates:
* First Release: 2018 - 12 - 01
* Public Release: 2019 - 08 - 22
